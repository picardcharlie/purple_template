# purple_template

capstone idea:
Create a character builder for the game New World that both saves and allows users to share them.

Currently there aren't any very good ways of doing this, as they either lack a way to save them, are clunky in their design or lack any sort of filtering.

New World is a game with "random" loot.  The main thing that changes is the "perks" on each item, with the highest level items having three on them.  The issue is that there are currently 900~ or so perks available, so there is a huge range in what gear can have on it.  Luckily, the perks are split up in to different pools and for the most part, can only have one perk from each of those pools, greatly reducing the amount of possible combinations, but still offering a massive amount of them.  With 10 slots of gear, there is a very wide variety of ways to gear a character.


What I would like to create:

1. A UI that offers a reletively easy way of selecting perks for each gear slot, while eliminating the other perks from the same pool if one is picked.
2. A log in that lets users save their builds and be able to revisit them again with ease.
3. Quicklinks.  Be able to generate a link to a custom build that isn't necessarily attached to any one account.
4. The homepage will have space for the most common builds and news.
5. A login page that shows an accounts saved builds and allows them to be edited and saved again.
